# Pop My Balloon
"Pop My Balloon" is a game where you **don't** want to guess the lucky number. Will you be the player who corners their friends and make yourself the winner by not guessing the lucky number.

## How to play
There will be a range of numbers from which players can choose a number. If the manage to guess the randomly chosen number, the balloon will pop and they lose. If they manage to avoid the lucky number, the range decreases such that their guess either becomes the new lower bound or new upper bound, and the balloon inflates just a *little* bit more.

The game has two levels:
- Easy Level: The range starts off as 0-100 and players can guess any number within the range. 
- Harder Level: The range starts off as 0-84, and players can only guess numbers that are either from the lower bound (LB) to LB+12 or from the upper bound (UB) to UB-12.

The game has two different modes:
- Text Mode: Players type their guesses manually into the guess box.
- Speech Mode: Players can say their guesses and the game will *try* to recognize and process what they guess.

We suggest at most 10 players, and we hope you enjoy playing.Let's Blow!!!
